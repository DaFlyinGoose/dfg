# Laravel 4 w/ Vagrant

A basic Ubuntu 12.04 Vagrant setup with [Laravel4](http://laravel.com/docs) and PHP 5.5.
PHP 5.4 w/ Apache 2.2 is available on the php54 branch.

## Requirements

* VirtualBox - Free virtualization software [Download Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Vagrant **1.3+** - Tool for working with virtualbox images [Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
* Git - Source Control Management [Download Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup


* Clone this repository `git clone http://github.com/bryannielsen/Laravel4-Vagrant.git`
* run `vagrant up` inside the newly created directory
* (the first time you run vagrant it will need to fetch the virtual box image which is ~300mb so depending on your download speed this could take some time)
* Vagrant will then use puppet to provision the base virtual box with our LAMP stack (this could take a few minutes) also note that composer will need to fetch all of the packages defined in the app's composer.json which will add some more time to the first provisioning run
* You can verify that everything was successful by opening http://localhost:8888 in a browser

*Note: You may have to change permissions on the www/app/storage folder to 777 under the host OS* 

For example: `chmod -R 777 www/app/storage/`

## Usage

Some basic information on interacting with the vagrant box

### Port Forwards

* 8888 - Apache
* 8889 - MySQL 
* 5433 - PostgreSQL


### Default MySQL/PostgreSQL Database

* User: root
* Password: (blank)
* DB Name: database


### PHPmyAdmin

Accessible at http://localhost:8888/phpmyadmin using MySQL access credentials above.

### PHP XDebug

XDebug is included in the build but **disabled by default** because of the effect it can have on performance.  

To enable XDebug:

1. Set the variable `$use_xdebug = "1"` at the beginning of `puppet/manifests/phpbase.pp`
2. Then you will need to provision the box either with `vagrant up` or by running the command `vagrant provision` if the box is already up
3. Now you can connect to XDebug on **port 9001**
