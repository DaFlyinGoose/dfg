<h2>Thank you for subscribing!</h2>
<p>I appreciate every subscription to my newsletter, to the point that I send each new person a welcome email inviting a response.</p>
<p>First I might as well tell you a bit more about me to open the conversation, I know the site doesn't say much.</p>
<p>I have been developing websites for over a decade, though have only been professional in the last {{ (date('Y') - 2012) }} years. I mostly play with PHP but enjoy dancing around the Javascript world occasionally too. </p>
<p>This newsletter started when I accepted a new job with a property company, I had a lot of articles to share yet no good means to do so (they didn't use slack), thus every week I would send round a digest. I wanted to add tracking to all these links to see which were the popular ones, but this added quite a lot extra time doing it manually, so I created this site to make my life easier!</p>
<p>As I built this site, I used the opportunity to play around with different technologies, to name a few; Laravel, Gulp and Administrator Package. When the newsletter distributer was completed I decided it was all well and good sharing great articles, but I wanted to contribute more to the community, and thus I created the blog which is probably what led you to subscribe.</p>
<p>So that is my story, now how about yours? I would love to hear back from you, tell me about yourself, how you got into development and where your interests lie! I also appreciate all feedback on my articles and any suggestions for future ones!</p>

<br>
Cheers<br>
